    This defense makes use of what is known as a {{
    lm.link_new_tab("https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet.html#parameterized-query-examples",
    "parameterized query") }}. A succinct way of explaining it
    is that a parameterized query interprets user input as data instead of code. A key difference between this challenge
    and the previous one is that it is predicated on the fact that developers often assume that anything in the database
    is safe because it is <span class="italic">their</span> database. However, if the database was populated using user
    input, then reading from the database is just as unsafe as handling user input through HTML form data.</p>
<p>Another technique that can supplement a parameterized query is to implement an allow-list. An
    allow-list specifies what characters are allowed as input, and rejects everything else. However, for
    most situations involving SQL injection, it is impractical to implement an allow-list because all
    characters are valid. For example, restricting what characters a user can enter for a password is
    considered a poor user experience. Therefore a parameterized query is the primary line of defense.
