<p>
    There are two main ways to defend against an SSRF attack: an allowlist, which is preferred, or a blocklist. However,
    sometimes an allowlist is not feasible because there are an arbitrary number of valid inputs to the application. A
    webhook is one such example where an allowlist is not possible because any public IP address or URL is valid.
    Therefore this solution makes use of a blocklist.
</p>
<p>A blocklist is very difficult to get right because there are so many ways to get around it. At a minimum, any
    implementation of a blocklist to prevent SSRF must include the following features:</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-8">
    <li>
        Rejection of any private IP address. It is important to note that this also includes any URLs that are publicly
        resolvable by DNS to a private IP address or from an {{
        lm.link_new_tab("https://www.acunetix.com/blog/web-security-zone/what-are-open-redirects/
        ",
        "open redirect") }}. This can be prevented by performing a DNS look up on any URL, and
        then
        checking if the IP address falls within the private reserved range.
    </li>
    <li>Rejection of any unresolvable URLs or IP addresses. Failure to do so could result in a denial of service attack
        on
        the web server. To address this requires having a time out on the request so that if it cannot complete in a
        certain
        amount of time the web app would just give up.</li>
    <li>Rejection of any scheme that is not HTTP or HTTPS. Examples of schemes that attackers might try are the <span
            class="bg-gray-200 p-1 font-mono">file</span> and <span class="bg-gray-200 p-1 font-mono">gopher</span>
        schemes.
    </li>
</ul>
