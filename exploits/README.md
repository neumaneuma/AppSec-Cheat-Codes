# CTF exploit scripts
These exploits are intended to show developers how their vulnerabilities can be exploited using code.

## How to run locally
1. Install python3 locally
    * I use version 3.9.2, but most versions should be compatible.
1. Install requests library with `pip install requests`
    * Use version 2.25.1 or above.
1. Use `python3 <name-of-script>.py` to run script
    * The default is to use the vulnerable endpoint on the local server, however you can set this to whenever you want. See **Miscellaneous** section below for instructions on how.
    * Optional command line arguments are provided to override defaults at run time:
        * Use `-p` to run against the patched endpoint, and `-v` to run against the vulnerable endpoint.
        * Use `-r` to run against the remote server, and `-l` to run against the local server.
        * E.g., `python3 <name-of-script>.py -p -r` to run the exploit against the patched endpoint on the remote server.

## Miscellaneous
* In [cli.py](cli.py), set `use_vulnerable_endpoint` to `True` to run exploits against a working vulnerability. Set it to `False` to run exploits against the code that has patched the vulnerability.
* In [cli.py](cli.py), set `use_webapp_url` to `True` to run exploits against the remote server. Set it to `False` to run exploits against the locally running development server. See this [README](../README.md) for more information on how to run it locally.
