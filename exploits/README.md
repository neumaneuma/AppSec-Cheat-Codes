# CTF exploit scripts

These exploits are intended to show developers how their vulnerabilities can be exploited using code.

## How to run locally

1. Install `python3` if not already installed (it is installed by default on macOS and most versions of Linux)
1. Use `python3 <name-of-script>.py` to run script
   - Optional command line arguments are provided to override defaults at run time (default is running against the local server's vulnerable endpoint):
     - Use `-p` to run against the patched endpoint, and `-v` to run against the vulnerable endpoint.
     - Use `-r` to run against the remote server, and `-l` to run against the local server.
     - E.g., `python3 <name-of-script>.py -p -r` to run the exploit against the patched endpoint on the remote server.
