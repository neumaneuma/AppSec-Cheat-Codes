# CTF exploit scripts
These exploits are intended to show developers how their vulnerabilities can be exploited using code

## How to run locally
1. Install python3 locally
    * I use version 3.9.2, but most versions should be compatible
1. Install requests library with `pip install requests`
    * Use version 2.25.1 or above
1. Use `python3 <name-of-script>.py` to run script

TODO create docker image with mitmproxy installed to make setup easier
TODO create branch for running scripts against local development server to avoid having to set configuration variables every time

## Miscellaneous
* In any script you want to run, set `use_vulnerable_endpoint` to `True` to run exploit against a working vulnerability. Set it to `False` to run exploit against the code that has patched the vulnerability.
* In any script you want to run, set `use_webapp_url` to `True` to run exploit against the remote server. Set it to `False` to run exploit against the locally running development server. See this [README](../README.md) for more information on how to run it locally.
