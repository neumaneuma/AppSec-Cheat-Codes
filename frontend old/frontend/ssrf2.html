            Software developers learn best when reading and writing code. Most CTFs are catered towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline" target="_blank">pentesters</a> who predominantly use a
            variety of tools for CTFs and in their day jobs. While certainly a more efficient approach, this does not,
            however, translate well for a software developer trying to learn AppSec.</p>
        <p>How is a software developer supposed to learn how to write secure code if all they learn how to do from a CTF
            is click a few buttons and enter some input into a text field? That is why the purpose of this CTF is to
            reframe the concept of AppSec in terms of code.</p>
        <p>There are 3 hints for every challenge. One hint will show you <span class="italic">the exact code of the
                server-side vulnerability that you are trying to exploit</span>. It is one thing to read a description
            of a vulnerability, and a whole another thing to actually see a working example of the code. Another hint
            will show you <span class="italic">the exact code of the exploit and how to run it</span>. Technically this
            is less of a hint and more just the answer to how to solve the challenge, but let's not get too hung up on
            semantics.</p>
        <p>The next logical step is to provide the diff between what the vulnerable code looks like and what the secure
            code looks like. This is accessible to anyone who solves the challenge, which considering the exploit is
            provided if you cannot figure out how to write it on your own, is literally anyone.</p>
        <p>And finally, as if this wall of text wasn't long enough, there is even more to it. If you want to run the
            webapp locally just follow the instructions on this <a href="https://github.com/neumaneuma/appseccheat.codes/blob/main/README.md" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline" target="_blank">README</a>. Make
            any modifications you want. Add code, remove code, break things, figure out how to fix them. This is what I
            believe to be the most effective way for a developer to learn a concept: through code.</p>

    What is SSRF?
</h2>

<p>
    SSRF (server side request forgery) is when an attacker can trick the server in to performing HTTP requests on the
    attacker's behalf. Examples of HTTP requests that can be potentially dangerous for a web application are requests to a
    private IP address (i.e., one that is not accessible from the public Internet such as
    <span class="bg-gray-200 p-1 font-mono">127.0.0.1</span>), requests to an internal admin API, or requests that use
    the <span class="bg-gray-200 p-1 font-mono">file://</span> protocol to access internal files on the network.
</p>
<p>
    How might an attacker pull this off? They simply need a server endpoint that accepts a URL or an IP address as
    input. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline" target="_blank">webhook</a> is a common feature these days
    that offers such a vector to attackers. The intended functionality of a webhook is to provide a way for client
    applications to receive notifications about events in real time. But instead of supplying a valid public IP address,
    what if an attacker supplies a private IP address?
</p>
<p>
    For example, suppose your web application runs on one of the major cloud providers such as AWS or Azure, and has a
    webhook endpoint. If an attacker provides the IP address
    <span class="bg-gray-200 p-1 font-mono">169.254.169.254</span> as input to the endpoint, then they might be able to
    access sensitive data from the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instancedata-data-retrieval.html" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline" target="_blank">metadata</a> <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/instance-metadata-service?tabs=windows" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline" target="_blank">service</a> running on the cloud instance.
</p>
<p>
    In plain english: the server is expecting a URL or an IP address as input. The attacker provides an IP address that
    is only available to access by the web server because it gives out sensitive credentials. The web server accesses
    this IP address with an HTTP request (the attacker is not directly accessing this IP address; this is what is meant
    by the server doing stuff on the attacker's behalf) and returns the response back to the attacker. Now the attacker
    has these sensitive credentials even though they were not able to access that metadata service directly.

    Heard about it in the news?
</h2>

<p>SSRF is arguably the most popular vulnerability being exploited today. It is not easy to defend against, and it can
    cause a lot of damage. Here are three recent examples of it being exploited:</p>
<ol class="list-decimal">
    <li>2019: Capital One <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/08/what-we-can-learn-from-the-capital-one-hack/" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline" target="_blank">suffered a
        breach of over 100 million customers because of SSRF</a></li>
    <li>2020: Atlassian fell victim to the same <a href="https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-12433" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline" target="_blank">webhook attack described above</a></li>
    <li>2021: Microsoft Exchange servers <a href="https://www.extrahop.com/company/blog/2021/exchange-server-security/" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline" target="_blank">were compromised to
        devastating effect</a></li>

        <p class="mt-4">If you are unsure on how to proceed, then the following may help:</p>
        <p>You can enter the input necessary to exploit this challenge manually through your browser, or you can use an
            automated tool such as <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline" target="_blank">Burp Suite</a> or <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline" target="_blank">OWASP ZAP</a>. However, since this CTF is focused specifically
            on the code side of application security, neither of those solutions will be presented here.</p>
        <p>The exploit code and instructions on how to run it is presented in the third hint. However, you are
            encouraged to attempt to write the exploit code yourself before looking at the answer. In order to do this,
            you need to understand what fields are being set in the HTTP request being sent to the server from the
            browser. This is so that you can craft your own HTTP request from the script you write. You can use your <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/09/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-secure.html-forms.html" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline" target="_blank">browser's developer tools</a> to figure out this information or you can use a tool that can decrypt
            encrypted traffic on your computer. Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP both offer this feature in addition to their
            automated pentesting. I personally used <a href="https://mitmproxy.org" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline" target="_blank">mitmproxy</a> when
            writing the exploit scripts for this site because it has a lot fewer features than those other tools, and
            therefore is a lot simpler to use. There is no right answer though. Any of those options will suffice.</p>
