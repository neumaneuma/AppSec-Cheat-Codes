      <p>
        Hi! My name is Bradley. I created AppSec Cheat Codes while attending a 12 week batch at <a href="https://www.recurse.com" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline" target="_blank">Recurse Center</a> in the middle of 2021. If you are a programmer, even with only a few months of experience, I would highly recommend applying to Recurse Center. It is a great place to get better at developing software and to meet a fantastic community of people.
      </p>

    <div class="pt-4 space-y-4">
      <h2 class="mt-6 text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">Why is this for programmers/software developers?</h2>
      <p>
        The premise of this web app is for people to learn application security through code. A programmer's
        primary skill set is first and foremost code. I find that there is not much out there for software developers to
        learn how to code securely in a hands on manner. This web app hopefully helps to fill the void a little bit
        more.

      <h2 class="mt-6 text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">What is next?</h2>
      <p>
        I have a lot more planned for what I want to add, though I won't be able to work on this full time anymore. Here
        is what I have in mind (not in any particular order):
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-8">
        <li>
          Port the frontend over from Jinja2 to Elm. I am not a fan of Javascript, so I decided to try using a server
          side template for the frontend. It turns out that I am not much of a fan of server side templates either. I
          tried Elm a few years ago, and I really liked it, however my functional programming skills are quite rusty.
        </li>
        <li>Add challenges for CORS, XSS, CSRF, and directory traversal vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>Add implementations of all challenges in golang.</li>
        <li>
          Change the bland purple color for all the cards on the homepage so that it is something with a better UI. I
          didn't know what to put for it since I have 0 knowledge of graphics, so the purple was just a place holder.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
