            <p>You can enter the input necessary to exploit this challenge manually through your browser, or you
                can use an automated tool such as <a class="text-blue-400 hover:underline"
                    href="https://portswigger.net/burp">Burp Suite</a> or <a class="text-blue-400 hover:underline"
                    href="https://www.zaproxy.org">OWASP ZAP</a>. However,
                since this CTF is focused specifically on the code side of application security, neither of
                those solutions will be presented here.</p>
            <p>The exploit code and instructions on how to run it is presented further down on the page.
                However, you are encouraged to attempt to write the exploit code yourself before looking at the
                answer. In order to do this, you need to understand what fields are being set in the HTTP request
                being sent
                here is scroll up
                to the server from the browser. This is so that you can craft your own HTTP request from the script
                you write. You can use your <a class="text-blue-400 hover:underline"
                    href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/09/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-secure.html-forms.html">browser's
                    developer tools</a> to figure out this information or you can use a tool that can decrypt
                encrypted traffic on
                your computer. Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP both offer this feature in addition to their automated
                pentesting. I personally used <a class="text-blue-400 hover:underline"
                    href="https://mitmproxy.org">mitmproxy</a> when writing the exploit scripts for this site
                because it has a lot fewer features than those other tools, and therefore is a lot simpler to
                use. There is no right answer though. Any of those options will suffice.</p>
