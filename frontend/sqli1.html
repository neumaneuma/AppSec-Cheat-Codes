    What is SQL injection?
</h2>
            
<p>
    SQL injection is when an attacker can trick the server into
    running attacker-supplied SQL code against its database. For
    example, suppose you are an
    <a href="https://xkcd.com/327/" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline">elite hacker mom</a>. You name
    your son
    <span class="bg-gray-200 p-1 font-mono">Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;--
    </span>
    and send him off to school.
</p>
<p>
    If your son's school has a server that is vulnerable to SQL
    injection, then when they go to add your son as a student in
    the school's database this is the SQL query that is run:
</p>
<p class="bg-gray-200 p-1 font-mono w-max">
    <span class="text-black">INSERT INTO Students VALUES '</span>
    <span class="text-red-500">Robert</span>
    <span class="text-black">'); DROP TABLE Students;</span>
    <span class="text-green-500">-- ');</span>
</p>
<p class="text-black">Black text is SQL code</p>
<p class="text-red-500">Red text is data from the user</p>
<p class="text-green-500">Green text is a comment</p>
<p>
    The intended result is for an insert statement to be
    executed. However, because the school is vulnerable to SQL
    injection, what actually happens is that the insert
    statement is executed, and then a drop statement is
    subsequently executed.
</p>
<p>
    In plain english: a student named Robert gets added to the
    list of students at the school, and then that list of
    students is subsequently deleted. This is how the student
    records are lost for the year. What would the SQL query look
    like if the school wasn't vulnerable to SQL injection?
</p>
<p class="bg-gray-200 p-1 font-mono w-max">
    <span class="text-black">INSERT INTO Students VALUES '</span>
    <span class="text-red-500">Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;--
    </span>
    <span class="text-black">');</span>

    Heard about it in the news?
</h2>
            
<p>In early 2021, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gab-hack-data-breach-ddosecrets/"
        class="text-blue-400 hover:underline">the social media platform Gab fell victim to a SQL
        injection attack</a> that exposed users' private messages, posts, and passwords. SQL injection
    is probably the most well known web vulnerability out there. It has been in the spotlight since the
    early 2010s. Yet despite that, it still remains a potent threat even a decade later.</p>

                <p>If you are unsure on how to proceed, then the following may help:</p>
                <p>You can enter the input necessary to exploit this challenge manually through your browser, or you
                    can use an automated tool such as <a class="text-blue-400 hover:underline"
                        href="https://portswigger.net/burp">Burp Suite</a> or <a class="text-blue-400 hover:underline"
                        href="https://www.zaproxy.org">OWASP ZAP</a>. However,
                    since this CTF is focused specifically on the code side of application security, neither of
                    those solutions will be presented here.</p>
                <p>The exploit code and instructions on how to run it is presented further down on the page.
                    However, you are encouraged to attempt to write the exploit code yourself before looking at the
                    answer. In order to do this, you need to understand what fields are being set in the HTTP request
                    being sent
                    to the server from the browser. This is so that you can craft your own HTTP request from the script
                    you write. You can use your <a class="text-blue-400 hover:underline"
                        href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/09/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-secure.html-forms.html">browser's
                        developer tools</a> to figure out this information or you can use a tool that can decrypt
                    encrypted traffic on
                    your computer. Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP both offer this feature in addition to their automated
                    pentesting. I personally used <a class="text-blue-400 hover:underline"
                        href="https://mitmproxy.org">mitmproxy</a> when writing the exploit scripts for this site
                    because it has a lot fewer features than those other tools, and therefore is a lot simpler to
                    use. There is no right answer though. Any of those options will suffice.</p>

    Explanation
</h2>
            
<p>
    This defense makes use of what is known as a <a
        href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet.html#parameterized-query-examples"
        class="text-blue-400 hover:underline">parameterized query</a>. A succinct way of explaining it
    is that a parameterized query interprets user input as data instead of code.</p>
<p>Another technique that can supplement a parameterized query is to implement an allow-list. An
    allow-list specifies what characters are allowed as input, and rejects everything else. However, for
    most situations involving SQL injection, it is impractical to implement an allow-list because all
    characters are valid. For example, restricting what characters a user can enter for a password is
    considered a poor user experience. Therefore a parameterized query is the primary line of defense.
