                            use a variety of tools for CTFs and in their day jobs. While certainly a more efficient

                            AppSec.</p>
                        <p>How is a software developer supposed to learn how to write secure code if all they learn how
                            to do from a CTF is click a few buttons and enter some input into a text field? That is why
                            the purpose of this CTF is to reframe the concept of AppSec in terms of code.</p>
                        <p>There are 3
                            hints for every challenge. One hint will show you <span class="italic">the exact code of the
                                server-side vulnerability that you are trying to exploit</span>. It is one thing to read
                            a description of a vulnerability, and a whole another thing to actually see a working
                            example of the code. Another hint will show you <span class="italic">the exact code of the
                                exploit and how to run it</span>. Technically this is less of a hint and more just the
                            answer to how to
                            solve the challenge, but let's not get too hung up on semantics.</p>
                        <p>The next logical step is to provide the diff between what the vulnerable code looks like and
                            what the secure code looks like. This is accessible to anyone who solves the challenge,
                            which considering the exploit is provided if you cannot figure out how to write it on your
                            own, is literally anyone.</p>
                        <p>And finally, as if this wall of text wasn't long enough, there is even more to it. If you
                            want to run the webapp locally just follow the instructions on this <a
                                href="https://github.com/neumaneuma/appseccheat.codes/blob/main/README.md"

                            modifications you want. Add code, remove code, break things, figure out how to fix them.
                            This is what I believe to be the most effective way for a developer to learn a concept: through code.</p>

                    What is SQL injection?
                </h2>

                <p>
                    SQL injection is when an attacker can trick the server into
                    running attacker-supplied SQL code against its database. For
                    example, suppose you are an
                    <a href="https://xkcd.com/327/" class="text-blue-400 hover:underline">elite hacker mom</a>. You name
                    your son
                    <span class="bg-gray-200 p-1 font-mono">Robert'); DROP TABLE Students;--
                    </span>
                    and send him off to school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your son's school has a server that is vulnerable to SQL
                    injection, then when they go to add your son as a student in
                    the school's database this is the SQL query that is run:
                </p>
                <p class="bg-gray-200 p-1 font-mono w-max">
                    <span class="text-black">INSERT INTO Students VALUES '</span>
                    <span class="text-red-500">Robert</span>
                    <span class="text-black">'); DROP TABLE Students;</span>
                    <span class="text-green-500">-- ');</span>
                </p>
                <p class="text-black">Black text is SQL code</p>
                <p class="text-red-500">Red text is data from the user</p>
                <p class="text-green-500">Green text is a comment</p>
                <p>
                    The intended result is for an insert statement to be
                    executed. However, because the school is vulnerable to SQL
                    injection, what actually happens is that the insert
                    statement is executed, and then a drop statement is
                    subsequently executed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In plain english: a student named Robert gets added to the
                    list of students at the school, and then that list of
                    students is subsequently deleted. This is how the student
                    records are lost for the year. What would the SQL query look
                    like if the school wasn't vulnerable to SQL injection?

                            However,
                            since this CTF is focused specifically on the code side of application security, neither of
                            those solutions will be presented here.</p>
                        <p>The exploit code and instructions on how to run it is presented further down on the page.
                            However, you are encouraged to attempt to write the exploit code yourself before looking at
                            the
                            answer. In order to do this, you need to understand what fields are being set in the HTTP
                            request being sent
                            to the server from the browser. This is so that you can craft your own HTTP request from the
                            script
                            you write. You can use your <a class="text-blue-400 hover:underline"

                                developer tools</a> to figure out this information or you can use a tool that can

                            encrypted traffic on

                            pentesting. I personally used <a class="text-blue-400 hover:underline"

                            because it has a lot fewer features than those other tools, and therefore is a lot simpler
                            to

                    Explanation
                </h2>

                <p>
                    This defense makes use of what is known as a <a
                        href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet.html#parameterized-query-examples"
                        class="text-blue-400 hover:underline">parameterized query</a>. A succinct way of explaining it
                    is that a parameterized query interprets user input as data instead of code.</p>
                <p>Another technique that can supplement a parameterized query is to implement an allow-list. An
                    allow-list specifies what characters are allowed as input, and rejects everything else. However, for
                    most situations involving SQL injection, it is impractical to implement an allow-list because all
                    characters are valid. For example, restricting what characters a user can enter for a password is
                    considered a poor user experience. Therefore a parameterized query is the primary line of defense.
